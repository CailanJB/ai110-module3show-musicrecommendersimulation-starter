# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

In this project you will build and explain a small music recommender system.

Your goal is to:

- Represent songs and a user "taste profile" as data
- Design a scoring rule that turns that data into recommendations
- Evaluate what your system gets right and wrong
- Reflect on how this mirrors real world AI recommenders

Replace this paragraph with your own summary of what your version does.

Modern recomender systems use a mix of signalks like behavioral signals like recording songs skipped, replayed, lked, or saved. They use item understanding like tempo, energy, speech, langugae, genre, to provide the best recomednations based on users preferences.

Our System:
Our content-based recomender will use a content-based filtering approach that uses song attributes to predict what users will love next. The flow is as follows: Our recomender compares each song to a user taste profile and scores how closely the song matches that profile using a mathematical formula with genre matchm mood match, acoustic preferences, and energy closeness so songs are rewarded for being near the users target values. The formula to calculate this is as follows: score = (genre match score + mood match + score + energy match score + acoustic prefernce score + dancebillity score). 
the scores for each category are calculated as follows: let similarity =  1 - (song category score - user profile category score) for each category. points = weight * (similarity)
Overview: compute per category points for each song related to user profile then add the points. if the scores between the song and user are an exact match provide +2.5 points if not caluclate using formula above. 

Our system priortizes the mood and energy first since in my opinion is what makes someone like specific songs. The final scores for all songs are ranked from worst to best and the top k songs are returned as recomendations. 

## How The System Works
Here is an Overview for the recomendation system:
1. Start with user preferences
2. Read the users targets values(most prefered categories)(example prefernces values not every user will have)
    - genre: 0.444
    - mood: 0.23
    - energy: 0.40
    - acousticness: 0.24
    - dancebility: 0.30
3. Compare user profile to each song in dataset
4. score each song on a sacle from 0 to 10.
5. If user category and song category are an exact match award +3.0 points for that category, else 0 points for categorical data like mood and genre.
6. For numerical data(energy, acoustiness, danceability compute similarity score using provided formula)
  - Energy closeness: up to +2.5
  - Acousticness closeness: up to +1.5
  - Danceability closeness: up to +1.0
    - similarity = 1 - absolute difference
    - absolute different = |category in song weight - user perfernce weight | 
    - points = weight × similarity
  7. Add up all the points for each category and that is the score for the song
  8. sort the songs from highest to lowest score
  9. take top k songs and these are the recomended songs

Notes: System might prioritze energy closeness since for me energy is one of the biggets factors in liking a song. Therefore system may have bias to those who like energy in songs as the defying factor. 
Here is the algorithm recipe, end to end:

Start with user preferences:
Read the user’s target values:
genre
mood
energy
acousticness
danceability

Score each song on a 0 to 10 scale
Give fixed points for category matches:
Genre exact match: +3.0
Mood exact match: +2.0
Give similarity points for numeric features:
Energy closeness: up to +2.5
Acousticness closeness: up to +1.5
Danceability closeness: up to +1.0

Closeness formula for each numeric feature:
similarity = 1 - absolute difference
points = weight × similarity
clamp at minimum 0 if needed
Build final score and explanation
Add all points to get one total score per song (max 10.0).
Save a short explanation of why it scored that way:
which categories matched
how close each numeric feature was
Rank and select recommendations
Sort songs by score from highest to lowest.
Return top k songs as recommendations.
Output each result as:
song
score
explanation
That is the full recipe: rule-based category points + numeric similarity points, then sort and take top result

scoring: add up all socres for each category. 
Explain your design in plain language.

Some prompts to answer:

- What features does each `Song` use in your system
  - For example: genre, mood, energy, tempo
- What information does your `UserProfile` store
- How does your `Recommender` compute a score for each song
- How do you choose which songs to recommend

You can include a simple diagram or bullet list if helpful.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

---

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

---

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this


---

## 7. `model_card_template.md`

Combines reflection and model card framing from the Module 3 guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

```markdown
# 🎧 Model Card - Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

Give your recommender a name, for example:

> VibeFinder 1.0

---

## 2. Intended Use

- What is this system trying to do
- Who is it for

Example:

> This model suggests 3 to 5 songs from a small catalog based on a user's preferred genre, mood, and energy level. It is for classroom exploration only, not for real users.

---

## 3. How It Works (Short Explanation)

Describe your scoring logic in plain language.

- What features of each song does it consider
- What information about the user does it use
- How does it turn those into a number

Try to avoid code in this section, treat it like an explanation to a non programmer.

---

## 4. Data

Describe your dataset.

- How many songs are in `data/songs.csv`
- Did you add or remove any songs
- What kinds of genres or moods are represented
- Whose taste does this data mostly reflect

---

## 5. Strengths

Where does your recommender work well

You can think about:
- Situations where the top results "felt right"
- Particular user profiles it served well
- Simplicity or transparency benefits

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

Where does your recommender struggle

Some prompts:
- Does it ignore some genres or moods
- Does it treat all users as if they have the same taste shape
- Is it biased toward high energy or one genre by default
- How could this be unfair if used in a real product

---

## 7. Evaluation

How did you check your system

Examples:
- You tried multiple user profiles and wrote down whether the results matched your expectations
- You compared your simulation to what a real app like Spotify or YouTube tends to recommend
- You wrote tests for your scoring logic

You do not need a numeric metric, but if you used one, explain what it measures.

---

## 8. Future Work

If you had more time, how would you improve this recommender

Examples:

- Add support for multiple users and "group vibe" recommendations
- Balance diversity of songs instead of always picking the closest match
- Use more features, like tempo ranges or lyric themes

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned:

- What surprised you about how your system behaved
- How did building this change how you think about real music recommenders
- Where do you think human judgment still matters, even if the model seems "smart"
